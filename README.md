Open Identity Framework
==============
Open Identity Framework is an open source framework for building your
own [OAuth 2.1][oauth-2.1]/[OpenID Connect 1.0][oidc] provider that adopts the latest security standards.

The project is inspired by [IdentityServer4][idsrv4], developed by [Dominick Baier](https://twitter.com/leastprivilege)
and [Brock Allen](https://twitter.com/brocklallen). We are grateful to them for inspiration and their help in developing
the open-source .NET ecosystem.

* This project is a free alternative to [IdentityServer4][idsrv4], but not a drop-in replacement
* The implementation only includes the part of [OpenID Connect 1.0][oidc] protocol that is compatible
  with [OAuth 2.1][oauth-2.1]
